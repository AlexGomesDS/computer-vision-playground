# MNIST

On this directory we will use the MNIST dataset to implement a
handwritten digit recognition system using 3 different models:
- log reg
- dnn with tensorflow
- dnn pytorch

This will serve as an introduction not only to image data but also to 
the packages sklearn, pytorch and tensorflow and as a comparison between 
the last two.

>  The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
